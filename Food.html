            <h2>Authentic. Awesome.</h2>
            <p>Imagine some meat on a plate.  It looks like a beef burger/patty
                 with a moist look and no strong odor.  It would be reasonable for 
                 a person to assume that it is red meat and that it is fresh and would be
                 safe to cook and eat.  But is the meat authentic?  Well that depends on
                what is being claimed about the meat and the accuracy of those claimsâ€¦</p>
